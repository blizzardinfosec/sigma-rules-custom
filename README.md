# ðŸ§© Custom Sigma Rules

This repo contains original Sigma rules I've authored and tuned for real-world environments across Windows, SaaS, and cloud platforms.

## ðŸ“š Categories
- **Windows** â€“ Authentication, PowerShell abuse, suspicious child processes
- **SaaS** â€“ Okta, Microsoft 365 anomalies
- **Cloud** â€“ AWS GuardDuty alignment coming soon

## ðŸ“Œ Conventions
- Mapped to MITRE ATT&CK
- Tuned for high signal, low noise
- Each rule includes logsource and detection context

Work in progress. Built to be used.
